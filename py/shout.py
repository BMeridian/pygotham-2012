"""
shout.py
=====
* create a function called shout_loudly
* it should take two parameters: word and n
* it should return a string composed of the original word with n * expclamation points

Example Output:
>>> shout("ouch", 5)
'ouch!!!!!'

* go back and give the parameters default values
* now you can call the shout function without any parameters 

Example Output:
>>> shout()
'default stuff goes here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'

* in the same file, call your function to test it...
* however, drop it into a conditional that checks if the name of the file is main
* now try importing this module in a new file and calling shout.shout() from the new file
