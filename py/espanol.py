espanol.py 
===
1. Write a that asks the user for input: a word to translate into spanish
2. Create a dictionary of spanish to english translations (for example, cat would be the key, and gato would be the value)
3. Retrieve the value from the dictionary and print it out
4. If the value doesn't exist, print out "no se"
5. You can do this without exception handling (there a method you can use on the dictionary...)
6. Extra Credit:  Wrap it in a loop so that it continues to ask the user for a word to be translated... until the input is "quit"

Example Output:
walsh:~ joe$ python /tmp/espanol.py 
What can I translate for you?
>dog
perro
walsh:~ joe$ python /tmp/espanol.py 
What can I translate for you?
>giraffe
no se

Extra Credit Example Output:
walsh:~ joe$ python /tmp/espanol.py 
What can I translate for you?
>cat
gato
What can I translate for you?
>quit
