<h3>About</h3>
<p>Covers some of the more notable features of Python: functional programming basics, as well as decorators, iterators and generators, and context managers. Discussion of where and why these features are useful, motivated by simple examples of real-world uses. Focuses on Python 2.7&lt; but includes brief mention of relevant changes in Python 3000. </p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>functions are "first-class citizens"</strong> what does this mean? how does this allow us to write better code? what "patterns" does this eliminate? what common patterns/idioms are there?</li>
	<li><strong>functions, objects, and callables</strong> what are functions under the hood? what is a callable? what are the various ad hoc protocols?</li>
	<li><strong>function decorators &amp; class decorators</strong> where might these be useful? where do these show up in the standard library? what is a function decorator? what is a decorator-generating function? what's going on under the hood?</li>
	<li><strong>iterators</strong> how does a for-loop work? how do iterators work on standard data types? how do I define my own iterators? how can I define my own tuple unpacking?</li>
	<li><strong>generators</strong> what is a generator? how do generators relate to comprehensions? what other things can be done with `yield` (e.g., coroutines)?</li>
	<li><strong>context managers</strong> where are these useful? what commonly used context managers are available? how do I write one myself (using a class, using a generator?)</li>
